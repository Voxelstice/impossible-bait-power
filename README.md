# impossible-bait-power
A stupid terraria mod i made in just under a minute to test out 666% bait power. Thank you adamanite chrome browser e for making me waste my time to see what this does

The only file you get here is the file for the script. Just make a new terraria mod with the impossiblebaitpower internal name, the basic sword being impossiblebat, then just copy paste code from this repo and compile. There's your bait.

Test this mod in releases, use cheat sheet to make it or get 10 dirt blocks and make it from the crafting table
